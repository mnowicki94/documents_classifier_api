todo:

- EDA
- simple model
- serve api


- test model with categoires Handle Imbalance - leanr more about those methods\\\



- tested different model—just
- check stories


experimetns:


- use / no use of one hot encoded features
- adding / no adding publisher to joined str whihc is later vectorized


BEST: no ohe, no publisher

Why It Might Be Better
Publisher Data Not Helping: Sometimes, including the publisher adds little to no extra predictive power if the headlines themselves are strong signals. It can even add noise or overlap in signals.
OHE Features: The additional one-hot features (e.g., “URL_tech”) may not align well with the actual categories or might conflict with signals in the headline text.
In your comparisons, the simplest model—just the TF-IDF of the text (no publisher, no OHE)—actually performs best. If your goal is maximum accuracy and F1-score, that appears to be the winning approach.
